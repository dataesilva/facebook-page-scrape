# facebook-page-scrape
This is essentially a blatant copy of Max Woolf's wonderful tool posted June of 2016. I'm planning to make a few personalized tweaks over the next few months including a script to do a content analysis based on key words.

Max Woolf's tool can be found at: https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper/blob/master/examples/how_to_build_facebook_scraper.ipynb
Additional resources used from: https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper/blob/master/py3.5_get_fb_posts_fb_page.py
and: https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper/blob/master/examples/reaction_count_data_analysis_example.ipynb

The content analysis tool is my own, but not currently in usable form.
